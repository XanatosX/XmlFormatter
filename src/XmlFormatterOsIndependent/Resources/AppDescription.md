This Application is based on the [MIT](https://github.com/XanatosX/XmlFormatter/blob/master/LICENSE) license. The app does use plugin to convert structured files into a human readable or flat format.

I do develop this as a hobby in my spare time so do not expect bugs to be fixed immediately. Feel free to create issues or discuss about the release by using the links above. If you want to participate feel free to assign you an issue and try to solve it.

Thank you for using this tool.
